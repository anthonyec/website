From the design I created repeatable image assets to add some looping animation to the start screen.

The stats are displayed in a carousel. Each slide dynamically changes it's illustrations depending on the numbers generated. The data is stored in a Backbone `model` and specific methods can return calculated numbers ready to be used in the template.

When you reach the end of the carousel you are given the option to find out more or share your results. Clicking share will generate a custom share message for you to post.
