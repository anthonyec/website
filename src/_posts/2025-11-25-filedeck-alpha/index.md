# How to install the FileDeck alpha

Welcome! You have chosen, or been chosen, to test out FileDeck on your fine Steam Deck device. Here is how to get it up and running.

On your Steam Deck, switch to Desktop and open this page in a browser.

> - Use `STEAM + X` to print up the keyboard
> - Use `STEAM + Right Trackpad` to move the mouse
> - Use `STEAM + L2 or R2` to left or right click

Visit [Salad Room](https://saladroom.net/) and enter the secret room code I gave you.

Download the `.zip` file in that room to your Steam Deck. Then extract the archive, it doesn't matter where but make a mental note.

Once extracted, run the executable `filedeck.x84_86`. A security warning will appear, select **Continue** to open FileDeck, then close it.

> ℹ️ Opening and closing FileDeck allows it to be executed later in game mode.

Open Steam in Desktop mode and select **Add Non-Steam Game** in the bottom left.

In the non-steam game dialog, select **Browse** to open a file selector.

Choose **All Files** in the dropdown to ensure the executable is visible to select. Navigate to where FileDeck was extracted.


Select the executable `filedeck.x84_86` and add it as a non-steam game.

You can now return to Game Mode and use FileDeck as intended.

Report any issues, bugs and critique to me through whatever channel. And thank you for testing!
