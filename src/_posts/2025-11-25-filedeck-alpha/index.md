Visit [Salad Room](https://saladroom.net/) and enter the secret room code I gave you.

Download the `.zip` file in that room to your Steam Deck. Then extract the archive, it doesn't matter where but make a mental note.

Once extracted, run the executable `filedeck.x84_86`. A security warning will appear, select **Execute** to open FileDeck, then close it.

> ℹ️ Opening and closing FileDeck allows it to be executed later in game mode.

Open Steam in Desktop mode and select **Add a Game** > **Add a Non-Steam Game**.

In the add non-steam game dialog, select **Browse** to open a file selector.

Choose **All Files** in the dropdown and then navigate to where FileDeck was extracted.

Select the executable `filedeck.x84_86` then press **Add Selected Programs** to finish.

You can now return to Game Mode.

FileDeck should now appear in your Steam Library under the **Non-steam** category.
